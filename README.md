# XAI: Introduction & Challenges

This repo contains the materials that were presented at the [iCORE](https://icore.tamucc.edu/) XAI Workshop. 

**`slides_XAI_intro.pdf`**

First, I showed these slides that motivate our interest in XAI and briefly describe a few basic concepts. 

**`icore_xai_workshop.ipynb`**

Second, we went through this Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how easily XAI library methods can be applied to explain trained models. 
I wanted to emphasize that the ease of using XAI has some danger: it is trivial to generate explainations without understanding what exactly they describe about the model.

Finally, I discussed a number of pitfalls and challenges when using XAI. This material is largely based on Christoph Molnar's paper on XAI pitfalls:

General pitfalls of model-agnostic interpretation methods for machine learning models. In International Workshop on Extending Explainable AI Beyond Deep Models and Classifiers (pp. 39-68).
